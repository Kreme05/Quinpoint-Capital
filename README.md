# Project Structure: Quinpoint-Capital (Wealth Mangagement Project)
An integrated wealth management application built for **Quinpoint Capital**, designed to replace fragmented onboarding and portfolio tracking systems.  

Developed a **full-stack JavaFX prototype** using **Java**, **CSV data**, and **modular services**, providing a seamless onboarding flow, portfolio insights, performance analytics, and secure messaging â€” all in one unified platform.  

This functional demo illustrates how a single, cohesive platform can streamline operations, enhance client experience, and modernize outdated workflows.
